## Features:
1. High level mathematical modeling in Scala using algebraic expressions
  * Linear and quadratic objective and constraint expressions
  * Higher order expressions cannot be defined or handled by the solvers yet
  * Addition, subtraction and multiplication operations can be performed on expressions
  * Exponentiation can be performed on variables (up to quadratic)
2. Supports various optimization settings by using existing mathematical programming solvers
  * Linear programming (LP)
  * Quadratic programming (QP)
  * Quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP)
  * Mixed integer programming (MIP)
3. Available solvers:
  * Open source [lpsolve](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/) can be used for LP and MIP
  * Open source [ojAlgo](http://ojalgo.org/) can be used for LP, QP and MIP
  * Proprietary solver [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) can be used for efficiently solving LP, QP, QCQP and MIP
  * Proprietary solver [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) (experimental)
